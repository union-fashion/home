# Union Fashion

## Why?

Currently we have no way of showcasing Postman as a complete platform. We may talk about individual features, or a specific flow of features that contribute to a practice such as automated testing.

By creating a demo company, this allows us to configure an instance of Postman in a best practice way, showcasing how the platform can be used for API development in an end-to-end fashion.

Union Fashion aims to be a fully blown demo company with organizational structure, teams, roles and how they interact with Postman visible. This will allow for a prospect to drop into the demo instance and understand how they could be working/what they should be working towards.

Everyone is familiar with the e-commerce example and how a website/app selling fashion items would work, hence the selection in this instance.

Using a demo space is key to this as it allows us to show Postman working in the real world, and brings our story/slides/pitch to life with a real world use case.

## Overview ([Video Walk-Through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2_r1jrZ2Ec))

Union Fashion is an online-only fashion retailer looking to disrupt the fashion market. Their products appeal to fashionistas and their online experience is at the heart of how they’d like to push the boundaries and become a market leader.

To create a distinct, bleeding edge website and app experience, Union Fashion will be harnessing some of the latest tech. Inevitably, this creates a reliance on both consuming and authoring their own APIs.

Management at Union Fashion understand and have bought into the API first approach. They know that Postman can help design and develop APIs which are more consistent, reliable and reusable than APIs of old.

Union are not only looking to power their themselves through use of an API first approach, but what makes their business unique is that they will be allowing independents, boutiques and small businesses the opportunity to sell their products through Union Fashion in a way indistinguishable from Union’s own product lines.

## Organizational Structure

Before diving into and explaining Union Fashion it’s important to understand the structure of the business and the requirements of key stakeholders/teams who will be defining and delivering the APIs that drive Union Fashion.

- **Robert Brown, Chief Executive Officer** - Looking for a good methodology to be followed on the technical front. Keen to ensure tech used within Union Fashion is consolidated. Wants to use company’s relative small size to ensure they are agile, early adopters and are providing a marketing leading online/app experience.
- **Jeff Jones, Vice President Engineering** - Looking for a solution which will help with a modern microservices approach. Knows that an individual, autonomous approach will mean their APIs are easy to integrate and reuse. Looking to solve the collaboration aspect between teams to ensure all engineering teams can depend upon each others solutions reliably.
  - **Susan Todd, QA Lead** - Looking to ensure integrity across all Union’s systems. Wants to be able to create integrated testing flows to join up the work of front/back end teams to verify end use cases as well as test parts of the system in isolation. Needs a CI solution and a way to monitor these flows.
    - Team 3 QA engineers
  - **Alex Wood, Front End Lead** - Alex would like to avoid several typical scenarios: handover of APIs from front to back end being complicated - outdated documentation, old versioning. For new developers joining the team Alex needs them to be able to consume and start working with their APIs right away. Looking to have input on the tests for APIs ensuring they meet their use cases moving forward.
    - Team 10 FE engineers
  - **Kim Oliver, Back End Lead** - Kim would like her team to spend more time building and progressing their roadmaps than worrying about documentation, debugging issues with the front end team and would like to ensure a consistent approach to how new APIs are developed and made available for the business.
    - Team 6 BE engineers
- **Holly Statham, VP Sales**  - Shared objectives of being able to demonstrate how easy Union’s APIs are to pick up and use through both demos and sales material. Having access to source of truth.
  - Team 3 sales representatives
- **Tom Hill, VP Sales** - Shared objectives of being able to demonstrate how easy Union’s APIs are to pick up and use through both demos and sales material. Having access to source of truth.
  - Team 6 marketing

We are in the initial planning stages for Union Fashion's digital transformation, and move to an API-first way of doing business, allowing the business to operate more as an online platform, going beyond traditional e-commerce.

## API Platform
Union Fashion employs a platform approach to building APIs, establishing an organizational wide set of infrastructure, services, tooling, and blueprints for ensuring that all APIs have the resources they need, no matter which part of the organization they come from. Providing a common approach to delivering APIs by ensuring all teams have the same platform to operate on at every stage of the API life cycle.

### Infrastructure ([Details](/platform/infrastructure.md))
To support API operations at Union Fashion, we are using the following infrastructure to define, deliver, and sustain APIs throughout the course of their life. Standardizing the services and tools we use across all teams at Union Fashion, and helping to guide new hires, as well as those who find their way to our organization via acquisitions, helping make sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to delivering APIs at Union Fashion.

This represents all of the infrastructure currently in use across APIs. Teams are not restricted to using just these infrastructure components, but they are required to submit a GitHub issue request the usage of a new service or tool, and making sure it is added to this list before an API moves into production. Visit the platform infrastructure page for more details on how this infrastructure is being used, or [the infrastructure workspace for accessing the collection for each of these APIs](https://union-fashion.postman.co/workspaces/64b778d3-9cc1-4454-b127-3565cc742288/collections).

### API Workspaces
Currently each API has its won workspace, but we as we harden our strategy for defining API workspaces we are also establishing a blueprint for more operational level workspaces. Providing collections that can be used to help move all APIs across the API life cycle, while also applying governance.

![alt text](https://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/union-fashion/union-fashion-apiops.jpg "Union Fashion APIOpes")

The goal here is to create a higher class of workspaces that can be used to deliver valuable resources and automation to API development teams, helping them be more organized in how they setup their workspaces, but also help them accomplish common tasks with the help of other higher level operational collections.

## Philosophy
Union Fashion is intended to be a reference implementation showing how to deliver APIs across the a business implementation most readers will find relatable. Our goal is to do as much of the work on Union Fashion out in the open using GitHub and Postman so that others can follow along. Using Union Fashion as a live sandbox for driving the API-first conversation, helping us center our efforts on a single point of reference across storytelling, workshops, webinars, and other channels.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues as the backbone of our feedback loop here at Union Fashion, providing an open, asynchronous, and auditable way of organizing not just issues, but anything that should be tracked as part of Union Fashion operations. Providing a one-stop place you can go to find out what is going on. Here are the relevant tags for drilling into the different dimensions of what is becoming Union Fashion.

- [Enhancements](https://github.com/union-fashion/home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) - These are the changes being planned, but not added to the road map as of yet.
- [Philosophy](https://github.com/union-fashion/home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aphilosophy) - These are general beliefs that emerge as we are building Union Fashion online.
- [Road Map](https://github.com/union-fashion/home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroad-map) - These are things that are approved for the road map but then need to find a version.
- [Tasks](https://github.com/union-fashion/home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atasks) - This is general platform work that needs to occur that may not be part of planned releases.

## Why Does this Matter?
APIs are critical to the Union Fashion experience, helping us establish ourselves as the next generation of e-commerce fashion provider.

- Allow for more easier publishing of data, content, and algorithms to known web and mobile applications.
- Ensure that data content, and algorithms are immediately available for publishing to unknown applications.
- More easily integrate all data, content, and algorithms into external 3rd party and partner systems.
- Reduce overall overhead and costs involved with delivering new web, mobile, device, and network applications.
- Increase the overall quality and velocity of new features and functionality being delivered across applications.

There are many more benefits of doing APIs, and going API-First, but these five areas reflect how we will be making a meaningful shift in how Union Fashion conducts business.
